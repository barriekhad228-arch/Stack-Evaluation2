# Stack-Evaluation2

# Stack-Based Expression Evaluator

## How to Run
1. Save all files (main.py, input.txt) in the same folder.
2. Run the Python program:
   python main.py
3. Check the output.txt file for results.

## Input File Format
- Each line contains a mathematical expression.
- Expressions are separated by "-----".

## Output File Format
- Each result corresponds to the evaluated expression.
- Same separator "-----" used as in input.

## Features
- Supports +, -, *, / operators
- Handles parentheses
- Uses stack-based approach

## Assumptions
- Input expressions contain only integers and valid operators.
- Division results are in floating-point but converted to integers for output.

## Limitations
- No support for negative numbers or decimals in input.
